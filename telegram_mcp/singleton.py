"""Per-session file lock guarding against concurrent Telegram connections.

MCP clients (Claude Desktop in particular) sometimes spawn more than one
instance of this server for the same configured session -- most commonly
when a connector is restarted and the old process hasn't exited yet before
the new one starts. Two processes calling ``TelegramClient.connect()`` /
``start()`` with the same auth key at the same time trips Telegram's abuse
protection (``AuthKeyDuplicatedError``), which can knock out *both*
connections rather than just the newcomer.

This module provides an OS-level advisory file lock (``flock`` on POSIX,
``msvcrt.locking`` on Windows) keyed by the session's actual identity (its
string value or file path), not just the account label, since two different
projects/labels could otherwise collide or one label could map to different
sessions across deployments. The lock is held for the lifetime of the
process and is released automatically by the OS if the process exits or is
killed, so there is no stale-lock file to clean up.

A second instance racing for the same session waits briefly (covers the
"restart replaces the old process" case) and, if the lock is still held once
the grace period elapses, raises :class:`SessionLockError` instead of ever
calling ``connect()`` -- so the live session is never disturbed.

The lock can only ever see processes on this host, and those only collide
at Telegram when they reach it from different IPs (dual-stack or
split-tunnel hosts). Where every instance shares one egress IP,
``acquire(shared=True)`` takes the lock in shared mode instead: shared
holders coexist with each other, but a shared holder and an exclusive
holder never overlap, so an operator who never opted in keeps the
exclusive guarantee. (On Windows, ``msvcrt`` byte-range locks have no
shared mode; a shared holder there takes no lock at all.) The exclusive
holder leaves its PID in the lock file so a refused contender can name it.
